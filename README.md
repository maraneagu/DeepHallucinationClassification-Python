## Description
Develop and train two models capable of accurately classifying images based on deep hallucination. The dataset consists of 12,000 image files for training, 1,000 files for validation, and 5,000 files for testing.

## Report
_1. Machine Learning Approaches_:

   - Describe the chosen feature set, such as HOG features, and provide relevant details.
   - Discuss the tested models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), etc.
   - Explain the data preprocessing and augmentation techniques employed.
   - Detail the feature representation methods used.
   - Present the hyperparameter tuning process, including learning rate, performance function, regularization, etc., supported by tables and figures.
   - Document all attempted approaches, even unsuccessful ones.
   - Ensure the report is a minimum of 3 pages (excluding tables and figures).

_2. Machine Learning Models_:

   - Document and utilize at least two different machine learning models.
   - Include explanatory comments in the Python code for better understanding.

_3. Performance Evaluation_:

   - Report classification accuracy rates, precision, and recall for each class.
   - Provide confusion matrices for the provided validation set.
   - Utilize tables and figures to present the performance metrics.
